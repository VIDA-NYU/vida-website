AlphaD3M is an AutoML system that leverages reinforcement learning to automatically search for optimal machine learning pipelines. It can discover complex pipelines that combine data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.

The system uses a grammar-based approach to define the search space of possible pipelines, and employs Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a neural network to efficiently explore this space.
