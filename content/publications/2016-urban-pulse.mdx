abstract: "Cities have a pulse—a rhythm of activity that varies over time. Urban Pulse is a visual analytics framework that enables the exploration of urban data to discover and understand these temporal patterns. The system supports the analysis of multiple urban datasets including taxi trips, social media activity, and 311 complaints. Through coordinated visualizations, users can identify recurring patterns, compare different neighborhoods, and understand how urban rhythms change across time and space."

Urban Pulse captures the rhythm of cities through visualization of temporal patterns in urban data.

## Key Contributions

- **Temporal Pattern Discovery**: Novel algorithms for identifying recurring patterns in urban data
- **Multi-Scale Analysis**: Support for analyzing patterns at different temporal granularities
- **Interactive Visualization**: Coordinated views for exploring urban rhythms
- **Comparative Analysis**: Tools for comparing patterns across different locations and time periods

## Impact

Urban Pulse has been used to analyze data from multiple cities including New York City, enabling urban planners and researchers to better understand city dynamics.
