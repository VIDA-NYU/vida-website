  SONYC is a smart cities initiative focused on developing a cyber-physical
  system for the monitoring, analysis and mitigation of urban noise pollution.
  The system uses a network of low-cost acoustic sensors deployed across New
  York City, combined with machine learning algorithms for automatic sound
  classification and citizen science reporting.
