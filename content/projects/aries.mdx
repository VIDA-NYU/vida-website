ARIES (ARt Image Exploration Space) is an interactive image manipulation system that enables the exploration and organization of fine digital art.

## Features

- **Dynamic Overlays**: Compare images analogous to a physical light box
- **Advanced Image Comparisons**: Feature-matching functions through computational image processing
- **Organization Tools**: Explore and organize large collections of art images
- **Interactive Manipulation**: Intuitive interface for art historians and researchers

## Applications

The system allows images to be compared in multiple ways, offering dynamic overlays analogous to a physical light box, and supporting advanced image comparisons and feature-matching functions, available through computational image processing.
