Domain Discovery Tool (DDT) is an interactive system that helps users explore and better understand a domain (or topic) as it is represented on the Web.

## How It Works

DDT achieves this by integrating human insights with machine computation (data mining and machine learning) through visualization. It allows a domain expert to:

- Visualize and analyze pages returned by a search engine or crawler
- Easily provide feedback about relevance
- Guide the discovery process interactively

## Features

- **Interactive Exploration**: Visual interface for domain exploration
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Combines human feedback with ML
- **Relevance Feedback**: Easy mechanisms to mark relevant content
- **Crawler Integration**: Works with ACHE focused crawler
