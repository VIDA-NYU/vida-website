ReproZip allows you to pack your research along with all necessary data files, libraries, environment variables and options. Then anybody can reproduce the research on a different machine, without tracking down and installing the dependencies, or even having to run the same operating system!

## Features

- **Automatic Dependency Tracking**: Captures all files and libraries used
- **Cross-Platform**: Reproduce experiments on different operating systems
- **Easy Packaging**: Simple command-line interface
- **Multiple Unpackers**: Support for Docker, Vagrant, and native execution

## How It Works

1. Run your experiment with ReproZip tracing
2. ReproZip captures all dependencies automatically
3. Package everything into a single file
4. Share with collaborators
5. They can reproduce your results with one command
