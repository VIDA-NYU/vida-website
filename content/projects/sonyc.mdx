SONYC (Sounds of New York City) is a project that leverages the latest in machine learning technology, big data analysis, and citizen science reporting to more effectively monitor, analyze, and mitigate urban noise pollution.

## Approach

The project involves large-scale noise monitoring across New York City using:
- Distributed sensor networks
- Machine learning for sound classification
- Citizen science reporting
- Big data analysis

## Goals

- Monitor urban noise pollution at city scale
- Analyze noise patterns and sources
- Develop strategies for noise mitigation
- Engage citizens in noise monitoring
