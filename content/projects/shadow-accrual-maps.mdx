Shadow Accrual Maps provide efficient accumulation of city-scale shadows over time. This enables urban planners and researchers to understand how shadows affect different parts of a city throughout the day and year.

## Applications

- **Urban Planning**: Understand shadow impact on new developments
- **Public Space Design**: Optimize sunlight access in parks and plazas
- **Real Estate**: Analyze sunlight availability for buildings
- **Environmental Analysis**: Study shadow patterns for energy and ecology
