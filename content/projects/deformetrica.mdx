Deformetrica is a software for the statistical analysis of 2D and 3D shape data. It essentially computes deformations of the 2D or 3D ambient space, which, in turn, warp any object embedded in this space.

## Capabilities

- **Shape Analysis**: Statistical analysis of anatomical shapes
- **Deformation Computing**: Compute smooth deformations between shapes
- **Multi-Object Support**: Handle curves, surfaces, point sets, and combinations
- **Population Studies**: Compare shapes across populations

## Supported Objects

- Curves
- Surfaces
- Structured point sets
- Unstructured point sets
- Any combination of the above
