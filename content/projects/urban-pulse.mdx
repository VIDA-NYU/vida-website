Urban Pulse is a framework for capturing the rhythm of cities through the visualization of temporal patterns in urban data.

## Overview

Cities have rhythms - patterns of activity that repeat over time. Urban Pulse provides tools to discover, visualize, and analyze these temporal patterns across different urban phenomena.

## Features

- **Temporal Pattern Discovery**: Identify recurring patterns in urban data
- **Multi-Scale Analysis**: Analyze patterns at different time scales
- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore urban rhythms interactively
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare patterns across different locations
