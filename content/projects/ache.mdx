ACHE is a focused web crawler. It collects web pages that satisfy some specific criteria, e.g., pages that belong to a given domain or that contain a user-specified pattern.

## How It Differs

ACHE differs from generic crawlers in that it uses page classifiers to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant pages in a given domain. A page classifier can be:

- A simple regular expression
- A machine-learning based classification model

## Features

- **Focused Crawling**: Only collect relevant pages
- **Intelligent Prioritization**: Automatically learn how to prioritize links
- **Flexible Classifiers**: From regex to ML models
- **Efficient**: Avoid retrieval of irrelevant content
