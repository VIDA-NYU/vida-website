This demo showcases interactive 3D point cloud visualization capabilities. Point clouds are collections of data points in 3D space, commonly used in computer vision, robotics, and geographic information systems.

The visualization uses Three.js and React Three Fiber to render point cloud data captured from real-world scenes, demonstrating how complex 3D data can be explored interactively in the browser.
