SONYC (Sounds of New York City) uses machine learning to automatically classify urban sounds. The project deploys a network of acoustic sensors across New York City to monitor noise pollution.

This demo showcases the audio classification capabilities, demonstrating how the system can identify different types of urban sounds including traffic, construction, music, and human activity.
