Urban Pulse is a visual analytics framework that enables the exploration of urban data to discover and understand temporal patterns. Cities have rhythms - patterns of activity that repeat over time.

This demo shows how the system supports analysis of multiple urban datasets including taxi trips, social media activity, and 311 complaints. Through coordinated visualizations, users can identify recurring patterns and compare different neighborhoods.
