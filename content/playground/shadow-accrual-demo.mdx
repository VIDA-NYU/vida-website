Shadow Accrual Maps enable efficient computation and visualization of shadow accumulation over time in urban environments. This technique supports applications in urban planning, real estate analysis, and environmental studies.

The visualization shows how shadows from buildings and structures change throughout the day and across seasons, providing insights for architects, urban planners, and city officials.
