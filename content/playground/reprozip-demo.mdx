ReproZip is a tool that automatically captures provenance of experiments and packs all necessary files, libraries, and variables to reproduce results. This demo shows how researchers can package their work for sharing.

The tool uses system call tracing to identify dependencies and creates a self-contained package that can be run on different machines without requiring users to install any dependencies.
