Creation of novel data management and analysis methods applied to urban, scientific, web, and public health domains. Our group has particular expertise in provenance and computational reproducibility and personal-data informatics.

## Key Research Directions

- **Computational Reproducibility**: Tools and methods for reproducible research
- **Urban Data Analytics**: Analysis of city-scale spatio-temporal data
- **Web Data Discovery**: Finding and organizing information on the web
- **AutoML**: Automated machine learning pipeline synthesis
- **Responsible Data Science**: Fairness, accountability, and transparency

## Notable Projects

- **ReproZip**: Computational reproducibility made easy
- **D3M (Data-Driven Discovery of Models)**: Automated model discovery systems
- **Vizier**: Open-source tool for building and refining data pipelines
- **ACHE**: Focused web crawler for domain-specific content
- **Domain Discovery Tool**: Interactive system for web domain exploration

## Research Themes

### Reproducibility
Making scientific experiments reproducible and accessible through tools like ReproZip and ReproServer.

### Urban Computing
Analyzing urban data including taxi trips, noise pollution (SONYC), and city infrastructure.

### Data Discovery
Methods for finding, organizing, and understanding data from diverse sources including the web.

### Automated Machine Learning
The D3M program develops systems that enable domain experts to create empirical models without data science expertise.
