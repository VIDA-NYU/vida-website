Development of novel imaging analysis methodologies related to segmentation, shape analysis, and image statistics. Our work is multidisciplinary, primarily collaborating with experts in clinical imaging on research in areas including schizophrenia, autism, and multiple sclerosis.

## Key Research Directions

- **Medical Image Segmentation**: Tools and methods for accurate anatomical structure identification
- **Shape Analysis**: Statistical analysis of 2D and 3D anatomical shapes
- **Longitudinal Analysis**: Tracking changes in brain structure over time
- **Neuroimaging**: Analysis of brain development and neurological conditions

## Notable Projects & Software

- **ITK-SNAP**: Interactive medical image segmentation tool for 3D images
- **Deformetrica**: Statistical analysis of 2D and 3D shape data
- **3D Slicer**: Open source platform for medical image informatics
- **DTIPrep**: Automatic pipeline for DWI/DTI quality control
- **SlicerSALT**: Shape Analysis Toolbox

## Clinical Applications

Our imaging research has direct applications in understanding:
- Autism spectrum disorder in infants
- Schizophrenia
- Multiple sclerosis
- Age-related macular degeneration
- Brain development in early childhood
